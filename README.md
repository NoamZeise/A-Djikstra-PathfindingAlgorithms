# A-Djikstra-PathfindingAlgoritms

A* and Djikstra implimented in C# console 
A square board is randomly generated and a few places are removed as vaild paths. Two random places on the grid are marked as start and end points.

The program shows The result of using both Dijsktra and A* pathfinding algorithms to find the shortest path between those points (if there are more than one, one is found at random)
